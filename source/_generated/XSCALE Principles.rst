XSCALE Principles
=================

**XSCALE** is an acronym for the principles of an `Agile
Organization <Agile%20Organization>`__. Also a
`language <Pattern%20Language>`__ of best practice for Agile
organisations focused on exponential growth. As a method for `3rd
Generation Agile <3rd%20Generation%20Agile>`__, XSCALE extends the
`Agile Manifesto <Agile%20Manifesto>`__ principles to `Product
Leadership <Product%20Management>`__, `Portfolio
Leadership <Continuous%20Adaptation>`__, `Culture
Leadership <Self-Organizing%20Transformation>`__ and
`Holarchy <Consensus%20Decision-Making>`__.

XSCALE practices are fully compatible with `Spotify <Spotify>`__,
{{SAFe}}, {{LeSS}}, {{Nexus}} and {{DAD}}, and have been applied
successfully at scale as a standalone method of generating completely
`Agile Organization <Agile%20Organization>`__\ s.
